## Introduction
This is a project on the call centre analysis of an imaginary eCommerce company called "Urbn Luxe." The project is to analyze and derive insights to answer questions that will help the store improve customer satisfaction.

**_Disclaimer_**: _All datasets and reports do not represent any company, institution or country_. 

## Data Source
Call Center Data: The primary dataset used for this analysis is the ([dataset](https://github.com/Crowei-Gibson/Call-center-analysis#:~:text=2%20Commits-,Call%20Center.csv,-uploading%20files)), containing information about the company's call centre for October.

## Tools Used
- Excel
- PowerBI

## Data Cleaning/Preparation
In the initial phase, I performed the following tasks:
1. Data loading and inspection
2. Handling Missing Values
3. Corrected incorrectly formatted columns

## Exploratory Data Analysis(Problem Statement)
- What is the overall level of customer satisfaction?
- What is the most common reason for call centre interactions?
- How fast do customers get response from each channel?
- Which call centre processed the most calls
- What is the performance of each channel?

## Dashboard Analysis

The results from the analysis can be seen in the [Call Center Report](https://github.com/croweigibson/Call-center-analysis/blob/38adf5d2d88f79d6714f7900d5011d38aaa1eef0/Call%20center%20report.pbix)

## Results
The results from our analysis shows that a lot of customers are unsatisfied with the service they receive. 
- 71% of calls to the call centre were due to billing problems
- 51.87% of customers left a negative review, while 21.54% left a positive review, the rest (26.59%) were indifferent to the level of service they received.
- The Los Angeles call centre processed the most calls with 42% of calls. 

## Limitations and Reccommedations. 
 The information in the dataset gives a limited view of what's happening which makes it hard to pinpoint customers are so dissatisfied. The analysis brings up more questions like why do so many people have billing issues? Is it a problem with the payment gateway or something else? I recommend collecting more data to give us a broader view of what's going on.
